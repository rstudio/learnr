The **learnr** package makes it easy to turn any [R
Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document into an interactive
tutorial. Tutorials consist of content along with interactive components
for checking and reinforcing understanding. Tutorials can include any or
all of the following:

1.  Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations.

2.  Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute
    directly).

3.  Quiz questions.

4.  Videos (supported services include YouTube and Vimeo).

5.  Interactive Shiny components.

Tutorials automatically preserve work done within them, so if a user
works on a few exercises or questions and returns to the tutorial later
they can pick up right where they left off.
