## learnr: Interactive tutorials for R

The **learnr** package makes it easy to turn any [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document into an interactive tutorial. Tutorials consist of content along with interactive components for checking and reinforcing understanding. Tutorials can include any or all of the following:

1. Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations.

2. Videos (supported services include YouTube and Vimeo).

3. Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly).

4. Quiz questions.

5. Interactive Shiny components.

You can find documentation on using the **learnr** package here: <https://rstudio.github.com/learnr/>

#### Deployment Dependencies Not Found

If your tutorial contains broken code within exercises for users to fix, the CRAN version of [`packrat`](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat/) will not find all of your dependencies to install when the tutorial is deployed.  To deploy tutorials containing broken exercise code, install the development version of `packrat`.  This version of `packrat` is able to find dependencies per R chunk, allowing for _broken_ R chunks within the tutorial file.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/packrat")
```
