Install the latest version of learnr from GitHub with the [remotes package](https://remotes.r-lib.org):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/learnr")
```

Or you can install the **learnr** package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("learnr")
```

learnr works best with a recent [version of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (v1.0.136 or later) which include tools for easily running and previewing tutorials.
