To create a tutorial, just use `library(learnr)` within your Rmd file to activate tutorial mode, then use the `exercise = TRUE` attribute to turn code chunks into exercises. Users can edit and execute the R code and see the results right within their browser.

For example, here's a very simple tutorial:

<div id="hellotutor"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('hellotutor')</script>

This is what the running tutorial document looks like after the user has entered their answer:

<img src="images/hello.png"  width="810" height="207" style="border: solid 1px #cccccc;"/>
