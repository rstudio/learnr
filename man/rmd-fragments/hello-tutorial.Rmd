To create a tutorial, set `runtime: shiny_prerendered` in the YAML frontmatter of your `.Rmd` file to turn your R Markdown document into an [interactive app](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-14.html).

Then, call `library(learnr)` within your Rmd file to activate tutorial mode, and use the `exercise = TRUE` chunk option to turn code chunks into exercises. Users can edit and execute the R code and see the results right within their browser.

For example, here's a very simple tutorial:

```{r snippet-hello-learnr, echo = FALSE}
source("../../vignettes/articles/snippets.R")
insert_snippet("hello-learnr")
```

This is what the running tutorial document looks like after the user has entered their answer:

<img src="images/hello.png"  width="810" height="207" style="border: solid 1px #cccccc;"/>
