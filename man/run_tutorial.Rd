\usage{
run_tutorial(
  name = NULL,
  package = NULL,
  ...,
  shiny_args = NULL,
  clean = FALSE,
  as_rstudio_job = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Tutorial name (subdirectory within \code{tutorials/}
directory of installed package), or the path to a local directory
containing a learnr tutorial. If \code{package} is provided, \code{name} must be the
tutorial name.}

\item{package}{Name of package. If \code{name} is a path to the local directory
containing a learnr tutorials, then \code{package} should not be provided.}

\item{...}{Unused. Included for future expansion and to ensure named
arguments are used.}

\item{shiny_args}{Additional arguments to forward to
\code{\link[shiny:runApp]{shiny::runApp}}.}

\item{clean}{When \code{TRUE}, the shiny prerendered HTML files are removed and
the tutorial is re-rendered prior to starting the tutorial.}

\item{as_rstudio_job}{Runs the tutorial in the background as an RStudio job.
This is the default behavior when \code{run_tutorial()} detects that RStudio
is available and can run jobs. Set to \code{FALSE} to disable and to run the
tutorial in the current R session.

When running as an RStudio job, \code{run_tutorial()} sets or overrides the
\code{launch.browser} option for \code{shiny_args}. You can instead use the
\code{shiny.launch.browser} global option to in your current R session to set
the default behavior when the tutorial is run. See \link[shiny:shinyOptions]{the shiny options documentation} for more information.}

\details{
Note that when running a tutorial Rmd file with \code{run_tutorial}
the tutorial Rmd should have already been rendered as part of the
development of the package (i.e. the corresponding tutorial .html file for
the .Rmd file must exist).
