  This is a demo of chained setup chunks and how it can be used to build up / share code.
---

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(learnr)
d <- 3
``` 

# Addition

<!-- We'll start the setup chunk chain with a regular chunk dataA: -->

```{r setupA}
a <- 5 
``` 

<!-- Note: we use `exercise.setup` to chain setup chunks. In the case of an exercise serving as a setup chunk, the pre-filled code will be used as the setup code. -->

<!-- We start with a simple single, setup chunk for dataB depending on dataA. This is the familiar setup workflow for an exercise. -->

```{r setupB, exercise.setup = "setupA"}
b <- a + d
``` 

Result of x should be 9.

```{r ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "setupB"} 
x = b + 1

```

<!-- Note: setup chunks can use the default value of the exercises. -->

Result of y should be 10.

```{r ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1"}
y <- x + 1 

```

Result of z should be 15.

```{r ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "ex1"}
z <- x + 6 

```
