```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
# requires gradethis (>= 0.2.6.9000)
library(gradethis)

# Create an ephemeral in-memory RSQLite database
# Using the example in <https://dbi.r-dbi.org/#example>
mtcars$name <- rownames(mtcars)
mtcars <- mtcars[union("name", names(mtcars))]

db_con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = ":memory:")
DBI::dbWriteTable(db_con, "mtcars", mtcars)
```

## Creating SQL Exercises

### Create a SQL exercise

To create an interactive exercise where the student is expected to write SQL code, you need to first create a database connection in your global setup chunk.
In this tutorial, I've created an in-memory database using the [DBI] and [RSQLite] packages with the `mtcars` dataset saved in a table of the same name.

````markdown
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
library(learnr)
library(gradethis)

# Create an ephemeral in-memory RSQLite database
# Using the example in <https://dbi.r-dbi.org/#example>
mtcars$name <- rownames(mtcars)
mtcars <- mtcars[union("name", names(mtcars))]

db_con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = ":memory:")
DBI::dbWriteTable(db_con, "mtcars", mtcars)
```
````

We've assigned the connection object associated with this database to `db_con`.
To create a SQL exercise, create a SQL chunk with two chunk options:

1. `exercise = TRUE` declares that this chunk is an interactive exercise
1. `connection = "db_con"` tells learnr to use the connection assigned to `db_con`.

You don't need to name your connection `db_con` — it can be anything you want — but you do need to provide its name as a character string to the `connection` chunk option.

Here's the chunk I used for the example exercise below.

````markdown
```{sql db, exercise = TRUE, connection = "db_con"}`r ''`
SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4
```
````

### Solutions and hints

Just like with typical R exercises, the code in the exercise box is the initial code provided to the student.
You can also provide hints and the solution in the same way, using the `sql` chunk engine for those supporting chunks.

````markdown
```{sql db-solution}`r ''`
SELECT name, mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4
```
````

### Checking student queries

Finally, you can check the student's submission using [gradethis] or your own custom checking code.
learnr will automatically provide the results of the student's query as the `.result` (in [gradethis](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/gradethis/articles/gradethis.html#writing-custom-logic)) or the `last_value` (for [custom checking functions](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/articles/exercises.html#checking-results)).

Note, however, that gradethis won't be able to automatically provide the results of the solution query as [`.solution`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/gradethis/reference/grade_this-objects.html).
Instead, you'll need to create the `.solution` object yourself.
But learnr will ensure that the connection object is available to the checking code.
(In custom checking code, it's available in `envir_prep`.)

Here is the custom result checking code I wrote for this example.
It creates the `.solution` result by running the query from the solution.
Then it checks that the student included the columns we requested and gives informative feedback if they have forgotten a column or added additional columns.
If the student's result is the same as the solution result (ignoring column order),
we tell them they did great!

````markdown
```{r db-check}`r ''`
grade_this({
  .solution <- DBI::dbGetQuery(db_con, .solution_code)

  cols_expected <- c("name", "mpg", "cyl")
  
  for (column in cols_expected) {
    if (!column %in% names(.result)) {
      fail("Did you forget to include `{column}`?")
    }
  }
  
  extra_cols <- setdiff(names(.result), cols_expected)
  if (length(extra_cols)) {
    extra_cols <- knitr::combine_words(extra_cols, and = " or ", before = "`")
    fail("You don't need the columns {extra_cols}.")
  }
  
  pass_if_equal(x = .result[cols_expected])
  fail()
})
```
````

## Example Exercise

### Select three columns from `mtcars`

Select 4-cylinder cars from the `mtcars` table.
Only include the columns `name`, `mpg`, and `cyl`.

```{sql db, exercise = TRUE, connection = "db_con", output.var="my_result"}
SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4
```

```{sql db-solution}
SELECT name, mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4
```

```{r db-check}
grade_this({
  .solution <- DBI::dbGetQuery(db_con, .solution_code)

  cols_expected <- c("name", "mpg", "cyl")
  
  for (column in cols_expected) {
    if (!column %in% names(.result)) {
      fail("Did you forget to include `{column}`?")
    }
  }
  
  extra_cols <- setdiff(names(.result), cols_expected)
  if (length(extra_cols)) {
    extra_cols <- knitr::combine_words(extra_cols, and = " or ", before = "`")
    fail("You don't need the columns {extra_cols}.")
  }
  
  pass_if_equal(x = .result[cols_expected])
  fail()
})
```
