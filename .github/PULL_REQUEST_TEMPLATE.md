## Pull Request

Before you submit a pull request, please do the following:

* Add an entry to NEWS concisely describing what you changed.

* Add unit tests in the tests/testthat directory.

* Run Build->Check Package in the RStudio IDE, or `devtools::check()`, to make sure your change did not add any messages, warnings, or errors.

Doing these things will make it easier for the learnr development team to evaluate your pull request. Even so, we may still decide to modify your code or even not merge it at all. Factors that may prevent us from merging the pull request include:

* breaking backward compatibility
* adding a feature that we do not consider relevant for learnr
* is hard to understand
* is hard to maintain in the future
* is computationally expensive
* is not intuitive for people to use

We will try to be responsive and provide feedback in case we decide not to merge your pull request.


## Minimal reproducible example

Finally, please include a minimal reprex. The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://github.com/jennybc/reprex#what-is-a-reprex>, and follow the advice further down the page. Do NOT include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or you've used `reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.
```r
reprex::reprex({
  library(learnr)
  # insert minimal reprex here
})
```

Due to the nature of learnr being interactive, if a reprex is not possible, please include a minimal learnr tutorial RMarkdown file that can be called with `rmarkdown::run` to produce an error or display the error has been fixed.

Delete these instructions once you have read them.
