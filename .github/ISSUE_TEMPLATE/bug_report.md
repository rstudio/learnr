### Example application *or* steps to reproduce the problem

<!-- If you're able to create one, a `reprex::reprex` (REProducible EXample, https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) is extremely helpful to us. For instructions on how to create good reprex, please see: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html .  We understand the interactive nature of learnr, if a reprex is not possible, please include a minimal learnr tutorial RMarkdown file that can be called with `rmarkdown::run` to produce an error or display the error has been fixed.  -->
