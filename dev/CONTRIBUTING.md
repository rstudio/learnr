    contributor agreement as appropriate. You can send the signed copy

3.  Submit a [pull
    request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

We generally do not merge pull requests that update included web
libraries (such as Bootstrap or jQuery) because it is difficult for us
to verify that the update is done correctly; we prefer to update these
libraries ourselves.
