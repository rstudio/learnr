```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)

write_csv(mtcars, "data/mtcars.csv")
```

### This exercise uses files in the `data/` directory

```{r read_mpg, exercise=TRUE}
read_csv("data/mpg.csv")
```

### Files that are overwritten within an exercise are changed

```{r write_mpg, exercise=TRUE}
write_csv(data.frame(x = "junk", y = "values"), "data/mpg.csv")
read_csv("data/mpg.csv")
```

### But overwritten files are restored between exercises

```{r read_mpg_again, exercise=TRUE}
read_csv("data/mpg.csv")
```
