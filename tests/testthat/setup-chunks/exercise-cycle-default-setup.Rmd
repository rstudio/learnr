  This is a demo of catching cyclic dependencies with setup chunks starting from an exercise chunk with no exercise.setup set.
--- 

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(learnr)
```

<!-- Note: when an exercise is missing a `exercise.setup`, we default to finding a `-setup` chunk. -->

```{r data1, exercise = TRUE}
1
```

```{r data1-setup, exercise.setup = "data1"}
2
```
