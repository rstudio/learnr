## Tests

### One hint

```{r one, exercise = TRUE}
1+1
```

```{r one-hint}
# one hint
```

### Two hints

```{r two, exercise = TRUE}
1+1
```

```{r two-hint-1}
# first hint
```

```{r two-hint-2}
# second hint
```

### Two hints plus solution

```{r three, exercise = TRUE}
1+1
```

```{r three-hint-1}
# 3 - first hint
```

```{r three-hint-2}
# 3 - second hint
```

```{r three-solution}
2 + 2
```
